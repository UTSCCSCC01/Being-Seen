Additionally, youths will can profiles that can receive donations however, the actual donation portion will not be within the first release of the app as it is out of scope for our 10 week allotted time. 

## Key Personas

### Geoff Terrance (youth)

Geoff is a 19 y.o student at a local college studying psychology.  He’s been homeless for the past 1.5 years.  Despite being a hard-working individual, Geoff is not exactly the smartest, so his OSAP and scholarships are not enough to cover most of his living costs. 

He spends most of his time on campus where can have his basic necessities filled, has access to the internet, and can be left to his own devices.  Sometimes on the weekends, he will go out with friends although he is always reluctant due to his situation.  He has been struggling to find places to stay and pay for both basic amenities and his education.  He tends to couch surf among friends however, sometimes is forced to stay in shelters, which he strongly dislikes as he believes it interferes with his privacy and sense of autonomy.  He highly values his privacy and hopes to be able to get out of his rut soon but he fears that he may not be able to continue his education due to his financial constraints.

Geoff would like to find resources for employment opportunities so that he can get a job and hopefully earn enough income to rent a place out. He would also like to join mentorship programs to hopefully improve his situation with his studies.  

### Alex Caruso (youth)

Alex is a 14 year old who has been in and out of housing for years.  Because of this, she feels like the system has failed her, because of its unreliability. 

In her free time, she likes to draw and tries to sell her art digitally on the web in an attempt to make ends meet.  Alex is pretty skilled with using her drawing tablet for drawing her mobile device for business transactions. Alex dropped out but hopes to eventually get her high school diploma and eventually get a degree in graphic design when the opportunity presents itself.  Until then however, Alex is focused on trying to get by. Oftentimes she must stay at shelters despite her previous experiences, getting meals from soup kitchens and even begging for money at times, which she absolutely hates.  Alex’s first wish she gets out of her situation is to pay for her own place to live but she struggles desperately to try and pay for necessities let alone pay for the price of rent.

Through the app, Alex can search up nearby shelters and look through reviews for each shelter, giving her the choice to go to the best possible shelter according to other people’s opinions. Alex would also like to quickly search up nearby soup kitchens and mentorship programs so that she can get out of her homeless situation. 

### Mark Smith (youth)

Mark is 16 years old and is new to being homeless after leaving an abusive household and no longer being able to stay at friends’ houses.  He is struggling to figure out this new lifestyle and is trying to figure out how to cope with it so he can get back on his feet as soon as possible. 

Ever since he was young, Mark had a passion for anything related to cars. He would frequently watch hours of videos on YouTube about cars on his computer and phone. Because of his passion for cars, Mark tries to pay for his needs by working on cars for other people while he typically sleeps in his own [car], not trusting most shelters.  Not concerned too much with schooling, he instead wants to focus his efforts on getting a decent job as soon as possible so that he hopefully can pay for a roof over his head and a somewhat decent meal however, due to his more timid personality, he lacks the connections to not only figure out how to cope with his newfound situation but to help find his way out of it.

Mark would like to seek apprenticeship opportunities for being a car mechanic. This could mean applying for car mechanic jobs directly, or going to any educational mentorship opportunities related to cars. Moreover, due to his traumatic past, Mark would like to seek out mental health services for advice on how to remain positive, despite his bleak present.
