## Partcipants
Kyle, Glenn, Mark, Yiyang, Ali, Lianting

## Analysis
Looking back at Sprint 3, we certainly much better at following the guidline of work completion, following the curve as opposed to finishing most of it at the end.  Additionally, we did well regarding teamwork; often helping each other with tasks to help optomise code and complete tasks quicker.  In regards to aspects we could improve on; planning is probably the biggest priority, with the profile page being much more complex than originally predicted and also delaying the development of other features.  Furthermore, we could improve upon communication in regards to blockers and making sure there are as few blockers as possible with respect to development.
