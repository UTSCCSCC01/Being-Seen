## Analysis
Looking back at sprint 1, we seemed to have aimed much too high in terms of veolcity, only finishing around half of our assigned points worth.  We also had problem in terms of finishing our stories, many stories had been started but had a single subtask preventing it from getting finished.  In terms of what we did well, we excelled at communicating with eachother, and being flexible with our tasks; often helping with branches that we weren't assigned.
