## Release Goal
Our release goal is to release an app that will enable homeless youth to browse through multiple categories of social services, shelters and relevant resources in order to help them.  Additionally, we wish to release an app that will allow youths to have customizable profiles with which they can encourage donations for themselves.  The donations, however are outside of the scope of this project.
