## Analysis

Looking back at sprint 2, we seemed to still have aimed a little too high in terms of velocity, only finishing most of our assigned points worth in the second week of the sprint. I think we should have considered assignment 1 more seriously, which would have prevented us from adding too many tasks for sprint 2. We also had a problem with not being able to finish the story regarding the log out feature, which was already carried over from sprint 1, so we should aim to wrap that over with soon.

In terms of what we did well, we mostly communicated well our teammates in the group discord and often worked together to help complete each other's assigned tasks. Given that we pretty much all had one week to work on the sprint due to Assignment 1, we were able to finish most of our assigned tasks, which shows our strength in learning new tech and working together to finish tasks efficiently.
